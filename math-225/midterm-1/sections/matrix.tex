\section{Matrix}

\begin{itemize}
  \defitem{Equivalent Matrices}
  {two matrices are equivalent if there is a set of operations that transform one matrix to another}

  \item A \textbf{consistant system} of linear equations has at least two systems;
  \item A \textbf{inconsistant system} can still have variables;
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overdeterminated System}

\begin{itemize}
  \defitem{Overdeterminated System}
  {A system of linear equations with more equations than unknowns};
  \item Such systems can have solutions (\textbf{rare, however});
\end{itemize}

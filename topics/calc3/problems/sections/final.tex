  \subsection{Equidistant}

    Equidistant means to have same distance to a point.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Planes that include points equidistant to two points are planes
      that
      \begin{itemize}
        \item In between the points
        \item Normal vector having the same direction as the vector between the
        two points
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Esitmation}

    \begin{equation}
      f\left( x, y \right)
      \approx f\left( a, b \right)
      + f_{x} \left( a, b \right) \left( x - a \right)
      + f_{y} \left( a, b \right) \left( y - b \right)
    \end{equation}

    aka. linear approximation

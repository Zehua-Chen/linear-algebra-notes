\section{Midterm 2}

  \subsection{Polar Coordinates}

    When given $ D = \{ \left( x, y \right) | x^{2} + y^{2} \le 1 \} $,
    x and y can be written as
    \begin{align*}
      x &= \cos\theta \\
      y &= \sin\theta
    \end{align*}

  \subsection{Directional Derivatives}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item When the direction is given using an angle $ \theta $:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $ \vec{v_{1}} = \cos\theta $
        \item $ \vec{v_{2}} = \sin\theta $
      \end{itemize}

      \item When given directions not in unit vector, adjust the direction
      to be unit vector
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Given Contour Map, Find Gradient Vector}

    Given a contour map, draw the gradient vector
    $ \nabla f\left( a, b \right) $

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Direction}: perpendicular to levels
      \item \textbf{Length}: Find the average rate of change in the direction
      of the gradient vector
      \begin{displaymath}
        l = \frac{z_{1} - z_{2}}{\text{vector distance}}
      \end{displaymath}
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Given a Point, Find the Curve of Intersection Between Two Shapes}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Find the normal vector of the two shapes
      \item Take cross product to find a vector that is the same direction
      as that of the intersection
      \item Use this vector to find the curve
    \end{enumerate}

  \subsection{Box and Octant}

    When a box is in the first octant, and one vertex is in
    some plane, the $ w, l, h $ are $ x, y, z $

  \subsection{Direction of Line in Vector Field}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Same direction, positive derivative
      \item Opposite direction, negative derivative
    \end{itemize}
